The purpose of this package (config.main) is to provide an example of how to use the config package.
The way that Go handles packages means this directory will not intfear with general usage. Go won't
even acknowledge its existence unless you explicity ask it to.

I had more here, but realized that it belongs in the main readme for the package.
